  about_me: `
    Hi I'm Christian a React frontend. The reason why I chose this branch of programming is because I like to work on the visual side of projects but at the same time I like the code. In the near future I would not only like to be a frontend developer, I would like to be an engineer in this field.
    I have been involved in the world of programming for approximately 9 years when I was studying Video Game Engineering, which I stopped for personal reasons. Two and a half years ago I resumed programming and trained with courses, documentation and in some cases answering questions in Facebook groups.
    During this time I learned to handle HTML5 and CSS3 quite well, working in the way that is recommended using the appropriate tags for each case and always thinking that the application is responsive at all times. I also learned how to use the React library along with its hooks and state handlers, API calls.
    I consider myself a person who likes to always be mentally active.. My next step in this field is to become a Fullstack MERN.
  `,
  short_version: `I'm a person who likes to solve things, I like technology but I would like to focus on Blockchain, I think we should all learn a little bit of programming basics, you can apply it to real life.
  
  Throughout 2021 I tried to learn, not just watching videos trying to follow in the footsteps of the master, I dedicated myself to really learning the technologies.
  
  I know that I can be an important member of a team, if I am assigned a task I'll do it`,

  work_experience: `I still don't have experience in the field, however when I carried out my projects I learned a lot.
  In each project I found a different way of working, I was adding more and more functions and getting more and more errors for which I give thanks for Dev-Tools.`,
